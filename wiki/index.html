			The Vans Warped Tour was a traveling rock tour that had toured the United States (including 3 or 4 stops in Canada) annually each summer since 1995. It was the largest traveling music festival in the United States,[1] and is the longest-running touring music festival in North America.[2] The first Warped Tour took place in 1995, and the skateboard shoe manufacturer Vans became the main sponsor of the tour starting with the second tour in 1996, when it became known as "The Vans Warped Tour".[3] Although Vans continued to be the main sponsor and lended its name to the festival, other sponsors also participated with stages or other aspects of the festival sometimes being named after them.

			The Warped Tour was created in 1995 by Kevin Lyman and Ray Woodbury, president of RK Diversified Entertainment, in production with the short-lived Warp Magazine and Creative Artists Agency. The tour began June 21 at the Idaho Center in Boise, Idaho, and ended August 18 in Detroit.[12]

The tour was usually held at outdoor venues, though on rare occasions it was held indoors. In 1996, due to problems with the venue where the event was to be held, the show was forced to be moved indoors to The Capitol Ballroom nightclub in Washington DC.[13]

1996 was the first year for Vans as a sponsor and they have been the main sponsor ever since carrying their name in the title.

In 1998, The Vans Warped Tour went international, including venues in Australia, Japan, Europe, Canada, and the United States.

In 1999, the tour started off in New Zealand, Australia and Hawaii in the New Year. It then started up again in the United States for the northern hemisphere summer before ending up in Europe.

The Vans Warped Tour has turned eco-friendly by using biodiesel for the production buses.[14]

In 2009, the two main stages were condensed into one and bands were given 40-minute sets, as opposed to the traditional 30 minutes across the previous two stages. Despite this, the tour decided to bring back the two main stages concept with 35-minute sets instead for the 2012 tour and beyond.

In 2012, the Warped Tour traveled to London, the first time the tour has left North America since 1999.[15] In the UK and Europe, Warped Tour is operated by English promoter Kilimanjaro Live.[16] The Warped Tour returned to London in 2015
