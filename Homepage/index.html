  		My favorite animals include orca whales, fox's and my dog Zelda. My moms maiden name is fox and so we have a family reuinion every year called fox fest, so that animal is special to me. Orca whales are beautiful and majestic and deserve to swim freely.

    	This is my dog Zelda. She is my baby and the most important thing in my life. She was named after the infamous game The Legend of Zelda. She truly is a princess since she is so picky in what food she eats.
