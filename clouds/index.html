<h1>Bubble Buddy</h1>
    <p>
      The font Bubble Buddy is a playful yet organic type font. The idea behind it to form a font that is made out of ovals, yet almost not being able to tell it is a bunch of different ovals. The style is derived from my idea of clouds and bubbles and just light objects, though that is not what you would think looking at it. It is also slightly inspired by the idea of the bubbly graffiti type feel of the art that you would see on the sides of buildings in the city.
